1. To submit a pull request begin by forking this repository. 
2. After forking the repo, type this in to the console `git remote add upstream https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git`. 
3. Verify that it's been set by calling `git remove -v`. You should see this.

```
origin  https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(fetch)
origin  https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(push)
upstream    https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(push)
```

4. Now you can add files/edit files. After doing whatever changes, go ahead and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel/pulls). I'll go ahead and merge it.

5. After files have been merged, your local repo may be behind. You can keep it up to date by calling `git fetch upstream` which will update your local repo to the master repo.
