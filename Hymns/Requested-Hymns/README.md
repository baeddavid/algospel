# Requested Hymns

Any Requsted Hymns should be directed here with a Javascript file. Please link the question and copy and paste the question itself inside the JS file as comments. Name the JS file something relavant to the question.

Completed hymns should pass all tests and have doccumentation on how it was solved. If you don't know the time/space complexity for the solution, open an issue for it.

Once completed, hymns will be moved to the Answered-Hymns folder along with credit given to the author of the solution.

To submit a pull request begin by forking this repository. After forking the repo, type this in to the console `git remote add upstream https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git`. Verify that it's been set by calling `git remove -v`. You should see this.

```
origin  https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(fetch)
origin  https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(push)
upstream    https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/eyybaebae/algospel.git(push)
```

Now you can add files/edit files. After doing whatever changes, go ahead and submt a pull request. I'll go ahead and merge it as long as it's not horribly incorrect.

After files have been merged, you local repo may be behind. You can keep it up to date by calling `git fetch upstream` which will update your local repo to the master repo.`

If you still don't know how to go about submitting a pull request to submit or solve a problem take a quick look at [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request) guide on how to set it up.
